			<p><img src="images/alarm.png" height=20px width=20px> News Flash <img src="images/alarm.png" height=20px width=20px>: 
			As soon as you step outside, you will burn to ashes - 
			<br>If we don't do anything about the current state of climate change, this 
			<br>could happen in a few years taking place on Earth, our planet. Climate Change
			<br>is the long-term change in temperatures and weather patterns. Both internal 
			<br>and external factors contribute to this. As greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, 
			<br>it traps the sun's heat. This would eventually lead to Global warming, which would have 
			<br>a major impact on all of us.</p>

					<p> Factory pollution is one of the greatest factors at causing Climate Change. It may look like it consists only of smokestack emissions 
					but can also include acidifying rain, chemical spills, greenhouse gases and toxic waste disposal.

					<p> Trees give us a lot of benefits, so why burn them off?
					Once forests are burned, their carbon is returned to the atmosphere
					as carbon dioxide, which is also harmful to the environment. We must stop 
					this immediately and instead, plant more trees.</p>

					<p> As the population of humans increase, the Earth could not hold the amount anymore. When this happens, 
					the environment will start failing. These effects may lead to epidemic, 
					limited resources for all of us, and worse, climate change.
